When we opened the machine we found that the alarm back up batteries were not charged, 2 of the LEDs on the front panel were broken and there was a sitcky button on the front panel.  We charged the batteries, soldered the LEDs and cleaned/adjusted the button.  After charging the batteries with an outside charger we verified that the machine's internal charging system also works.

The screen using the skin temperature probe appeared to be working, however, the hospital does not have the proper probe attachment making that screen essntially useless. So, after looking at th manual and finding out that it might be a problem with a few diodes that were common to both displays, we attempted to desolder and switch the two sets of diodes, however this not fix the problem. It is likely an issue with the processor, which would have been impossible to desolder by hand.

Rwanda,Mechanical Simple,"Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",Davis Boatright and Brian Ramos,##,Eastern Medical ,2015,EA-632,Ginduwe Hospical/Bushenge Hospital,"Autoclave: the autoclave being used by the hospital was not heating to correct temperature and also not draining after the cycle was complete. First began by checking the filter and the tubing to see if it was clogged. The filter and tubing was cleaned, but autoclave still did not drain properly. It was determined that the electronic valve that releases the water was not functioning correctly. 

We started a cycle with the lid open to see if the heating element was working. The bottom element was not heating, making it impossible for the autoclave to sterilize. First checked power supply, and to our surprise there was sufficient power being supplied to the heating element. Using the multimeter we found that there was not continuity in the heating element.  Removed the heating element and cleaned it, but this did not fix the continuity problem. 

Our BMETs told us there was an identical autoclave in storage that was not working and had not been used in over 10 years. We tested the autoclave in storage, and found that it had a working heating element and control panel that was in much better condition. The problem was that it was missing a few parts like the electric valve, pressure release valve, back panel, and handles for opening the autoclave. It was also not getting sufficient power to the heating element and control panel. We double-checked the circuitry of the machine and found that a few of the connections had been removed, not allowing power to get to certain components. After reconnecting the cables, we were able to get power to the entire autoclave. We took the missing parts from the other autoclave, and got it to run a complete cycle! After a few tests, we can say we that we have a fully functioning autoclave for the hospital to use!

Rwanda,Other,Incubator (infant),Davis Boatright and Brian Ramos,41265.0,Weyer,2015,WY2410,Ginduwe Hospical/Bushenge Hospital,"Error alarm sounding immediately once turned on. French is set language for machine. To make easier to diagnose the problem, we found out how to change the language to English in the settings menu. Once in English, it was determined that there were two error alarms going off on the incubator. The first was an indicating a low battery for the alarm. The second was indicating a malfunctioning patient sensor. This machine was one of two identical infant incubators in the room. We took the same sensor from the other incubator and tried it with the broken incubator. There was no alarm. Therefore we assumed that the sensor must be faulty. To confirm this, we plugged it into the working incubator. Surprisingly, it worked.

Low battery alarm, took out lithium battery inside machine. Turned out to be the Ram battery. The alarm battery was actually missing.  Need to replace.  Contacted the manufacturer and they gave us the exact specifications on replacing the alarm battery. 

The alarm battery is a standard Lithium battery size AA 3,6V / 2200mAh.

Low water level alarm was sounding. We simply added water to the distilled water supply. 

Ram battery error: After removing the Ram batter, and putting it back in, the machine was giving us an error. We were not able to find the fix for the error initially. Contacted the manufacturer, and they responded with. 

When the monitor is not working after replacement of the RAM battery and if the alarm is still there, the monitor must be re-initialized according to the enclosed instruction. For safety sake I also enclose a photo regarding the battery positions and a video showing the re-initialization.

Followed their instructions and now there is no ram batter error alarm.

Incubator Doors: Adhesive on doors of incubator has failed, causing the incubator to have trouble heating. In past, the technicians had used super glue to fix the problem, but that had failed as well.  Contemplated between using epoxy or drilling new holes to connect doors to machine. BMET favored driller new holes to put screws in. This was done and now door works well. 
Error alarm sounding immediately once turned on. French is set language for machine. To make easier to diagnose the problem, we found out how to change the language to English in the settings menu. Once in English, it was determined that there were two error alarms going off on the incubator. The first was an indicating a low battery for the alarm. The second was indicating a malfunctioning patient sensor. This machine was one of two identical infant incubators in the room. We took the same sensor from the other incubator and tried it with the broken incubator. There was no alarm. Therefore we assumed that the sensor must be faulty. To confirm this, we plugged it into the working incubator. Surprisingly, it worked.

Low battery alarm, took out lithium battery inside machine. Turned out to be the Ram battery. The alarm battery was actually missing.  Need to replace.  Contacted the manufacturer and they gave us the exact specifications on replacing the alarm battery.

The service manual told us to contact a Siemens representative is problem was not resolved. We found a rep in Kigali and immediately called. Handed the phone to x-ray tech who new the rep. This helped get the ball rolling on having the rep come out and help fix the x-ray machine. This was important because it is a new machine and still under warranty.  After further research, it we determined that the problem was in one of the contact pads in the xray machine.

After assembling the device the airflow was good, similar to that of a device that we repaired earlier but it was still not powerful enough to nebulise 3 masks. We came to the conclusion that they found a 3-way divider and attached it to the device but that the motor was not powerful enough to nebulise all 3 masks. We showed the nurses that if they closed 1 of the outlets they could nebulise 2 masks and explained that in order to get nebulisation in 2 masks it was necessary for the valve to be closed.

We found this clinic through some American doctors that we met at our hospital. This was a hearing clinic that they were working at for a couple of weeks. The problem with the microscope was that the ceramic housing for the lightbulb had deteriorated to the point where the doctor had to take it out. He did not have the means to make a secure connection between the wires and the bulb so it was very loose and would often flicker and have to be adjusted. We removed the crimp wrapping and clips that he had attached which was making a faulty connection. We then soldered alligator clips to the ends of the wires, putting heat shrink wrap around the ends but not shrinking it. This stopped the clips from shorting but allowed for the light bulb to be attached and removed easily. ",Repaired

After turning the switch on the machine it functioned well, a seal inside needed to be re-attached but other than that it worked perfectly well.

We examined the lead and saw that it had been repaired before. We were getting continuity through all the leads except the 3rd so we assumed that was the problem. We removed the electrical tape which was on the outside of the lead and found a wire that had been used to bypass the broked one innside the lead. We removed it and replaced it. We assumed that we fixed the problem however the machine was getting alot of feed back. We replaced the wire with one of the same gauge as inside the cable and covered the entire thing in electric tape. The machine was getting much less feed back but it was still not back lot be put back into service. We tested the maching with a working lead and it worked perfectly which confirmed our concerns about the cable. We covered the outside of the cable with Aluminum foil which reduced the amount of noice that was being detected but it was still not working correctly. ,Abandoned
