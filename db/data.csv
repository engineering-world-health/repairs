Only noticed thereafter that it needed a high-current transformer (uses 9.4 A). Removing vacuum (which requires 8.2 of the 9.4 A) and made new cable to allow the saw to be used independently (grounding soldered to transformer casing). Concern was raised that the blade vibrates back and forth, rather than rotating continuously. This was later confirmed to be intentional. Tested successfully on piece of foam.

When we originally tested the machine we found the same problem but then realized we were not using the machine properly indicating possible user error.  When we opened the machine we found that the alarm back up batteries were not charged, 2 of the LEDs on the front panel were broken and there was a sitcky button on the front panel.  We charged the batteries, soldered the LEDs and cleaned/adjusted the button.  After charging the batteries with an outside charger we verified that the machine's internal charging system also works. After testing it, numbers flashing on the screen suggested a problem with a connection with the dial. We are currently looking into ordering a new one."

After ruling out the possibility of a problem with the LEDs, it was determined that it was likely a problem with the logic board. The screen using the skin temperature probe appeared to be working, however, the hospital does not have the proper probe attachment making that screen essntially useless. So, after looking at th manual and finding out that it might be a problem with a few diodes that were common to both displays, we attempted to desolder and switch the two sets of diodes, however this not fix the problem. It is likely an issue with the processor, which would have been impossible to desolder by hand. Instead, we are going to install a thermometer on the inside of the incubator that is easy to read so that the nurses will be able to see the temperature."

After assembling the device the airflow was good, similar to that of a device that we repaired earlier but it was still not powerful enough to nebulise 3 masks. We came to the conclusion that they found a 3-way divider and attached it to the device but that the motor was not powerful enough to nebulise all 3 masks. We showed the nurses that if they closed 1 of the outlets they could nebulise 2 masks and explained that in order to get nebulisation in 2 masks it was necessary for the valve to be closed. "

The problem with the microscope was that the ceramic housing for the lightbulb had deteriorated to the point where the doctor had to take it out. He did not have the means to make a secure connection between the wires and the bulb so it was very loose and would often flicker and have to be adjusted. We removed the crimp wrapping and clips that he had attached which was making a faulty connection. We then soldered alligator clips to the ends of the wires, putting heat shrink wrap around the ends but not shrinking it.

We fixed this by evenly sanding down the carbon brushes, but then found that the motor made a loud noise when operating. We found that one of the bearings was uneven, which broke when we tried to remove it. A replacement bearing was found at the ferreteria, and the machine was cleaned and returned to service."

Two machines were sent to CEMED, one of which was returned fixed with a new on/off switch and the other of which could not be fixed because of a broken screen. Of the two remaining broken ones, we were able to determine that one was functional but could not be used to charge a battery and the other was broken, even with a fully charged battery. All in all, the OR now has three functional pulse oximeters, two of which operate and can be plugged in to charge the battery, and one that works if a charged battery is inserted (or non-rechargable batteries are used)."

2015,Rwanda,Ginduwe Hospical/Bushenge Hospital,Davis Boatright and Brian Ramos,"Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",Eastern Medical ,EA-632,##,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"Autoclave: the autoclave being used by the hospital was not heating to correct temperature and also not draining after the cycle was complete. First began by checking the filter and the tubing to see if it was clogged. The filter and tubing was cleaned, but autoclave still did not drain properly. It was determined that the electronic valve that releases the water was not functioning correctly. 

We started a cycle with the lid open to see if the heating element was working. The bottom element was not heating, making it impossible for the autoclave to sterilize. First checked power supply, and to our surprise there was sufficient power being supplied to the heating element. Using the multimeter we found that there was not continuity in the heating element.  Removed the heating element and cleaned it, but this did not fix the continuity problem. 

Our BMETs told us there was an identical autoclave in storage that was not working and had not been used in over 10 years. We tested the autoclave in storage, and found that it had a working heating element and control panel that was in much better condition. The problem was that it was missing a few parts like the electric valve, pressure release valve, back panel, and handles for opening the autoclave. It was also not getting sufficient power to the heating element and control panel. We double-checked the circuitry of the machine and found that a few of the connections had been removed, not allowing power to get to certain components. After reconnecting the cables, we were able to get power to the entire autoclave. We took the missing parts from the other autoclave, and got it to run a complete cycle! After a few tests, we can say we that we have a fully functioning autoclave for the hospital to use!

French is set language for machine. To make easier to diagnose the problem, we found out how to change the language to English in the settings menu. Once in English, it was determined that there were two error alarms going off on the incubator. The first was an indicating a low battery for the alarm. The second was indicating a malfunctioning patient sensor. This machine was one of two identical infant incubators in the room. We took the same sensor from the other incubator and tried it with the broken incubator. There was no alarm. Therefore we assumed that the sensor must be faulty. To confirm this, we plugged it into the working incubator. Surprisingly, it worked.

Low battery alarm, took out lithium battery inside machine. Turned out to be the Ram battery. The alarm battery was actually missing.  Need to replace.  Contacted the manufacturer and they gave us the exact specifications on replacing the alarm battery. 

The alarm battery is a standard Lithium battery size AA 3,6V / 2200mAh.

Low water level alarm was sounding. We simply added water to the distilled water supply. 

Ram battery error: After removing the Ram batter, and putting it back in, the machine was giving us an error. We were not able to find the fix for the error initially. Contacted the manufacturer, and they responded with. 

When the monitor is not working after replacement of the RAM battery and if the alarm is still there, the monitor must be re-initialized according to the enclosed instruction. For safety sake I also enclose a photo regarding the battery positions and a video showing the re-initialization.

Followed their instructions and now there is no ram batter error alarm.

Incubator Doors: Adhesive on doors of incubator has failed, causing the incubator to have trouble heating. In past, the technicians had used super glue to fix the problem, but that had failed as well.  Contemplated between using epoxy or drilling new holes to connect doors to machine. BMET favored driller new holes to put screws in. This was done and now door works well.

The error was Err 0022, and was not letting the machine perform x-rays. Using the service manual it was determined that the error was being caused by a problem with the generator. The service manual gave us two things to try to erase the problem. First erase the memory, then shut off the generator and turn back on. This did not fix the error. The service manual told us to contact a Siemens representative is problem was not resolved. We found a rep in Kigali and immediately called. Handed the phone to x-ray tech who new the rep. This helped get the ball rolling on having the rep come out and help fix the x-ray machine. This was important because it is a new machine and still under warranty.

We took off the cover and opened up the electrical components, checking continuty from the plug with a multimeter. Many of the connections were plugs with plastic covers that could be pulled off and replaced, which we did to check continuity. We also cleaned a little with a brush. We also unscrewed the circuit board to make sure everything was still soldered onto it. After putting the electrical components back together we tested the unit using a wire attached to a plug, since the shape of the unit didn't match the outlets in the workshop. The unit also required 220 V, but we tried it on 125 V. The unit turned on, we could adjust temperature, and air was flowing. We put the unit back together and put it back in the office to test it, where the outlet matched the plug and measured at 200 V. The unit worked in the office."

They then had put a red polymer on top, which looked like a liquid or gel that was supposed to insulate the wire once it dried. We picked off the red material, disconnected the extra wire, and shielded the wire and probe with tin foil. We checked continuity to make sure that the shielding on the wire was attached to the shielding on the probe. We hypothesized that  whoever tried to fix it before us didn't realize that it was shielding instead of a physical connection. We shielded everything and sealed it in place with heat shrink. When it was plugged into the doppler we found that we got more sounds and more numbers, but they still weren't accurate and a consistent heartbeat was not heard.

Both had a weak air stream. We took them apart, cleaned all of the tubing, cleaned the electrical connections with contact cleaner, and greased the piston. When reassembled the air stream was still weak. The technician told us that at this point the motor was just old and weak, and we couldn't do much more."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai",Fetal steth (fetoscope or  Doppler),Bionet,BabyCare,BD0100229,Electric Simple,Repaired,"This dopper was missing a battery, so we hooked it up to our power supply at 9 volts. At first there was no sound coming from it, when we realized that although the casing looked like it had a speaker there was no speaker installed. We hooked the doppler up to some headphones and got an inconsistent sound, when we noticed that the headphone jack was falling off of the board. We resoldered the pins of it. The pins in the battery pack snapped off, so we cut open the plastic and inserted a 9 V battery connector that was in our tool kit, soldering it directly to the board. With a solid headphone connection and a new battery case, the doppler functioned perfectly."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai",Automatic Voltage Regulator,Tripp-Lite,,VH003506,Electric Simple,Repaired,"The overload/check battery light came on when the surge protector was plugged into the wall, so we opened it up, cleaned the entire board with contact cleaner, and tested the voltage on the battery. The battery was charged to its normal 12 V, so we looked for oxidation on the board and transformer and removed it. Once cleaned and put back together, the regulator functioned properly."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai",Automatic Voltage Regulator,Tripp-Lite,,,Electric Simple,Abandoned,"The battery for this device was at 2 V instead of the needed 12 V, and even when the battery was switched out into a working surge protector it wouldn't charge, so we knew that the battery voltage was just too low to recharge it. We're waiting on the purchase of a new battery."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai",Other,Leisegang,1.0,14224.0,Electric Simple,,"This colposcope is located in external consulting next to the gyenecological examination bed. It is attached to another examination bed with a sheet thrown over it and seems to have come with the bed. The doctor showed us the device claiming that they just need a replacement lightbulb. We asked administration for the old blown out bulb to try and replace it, but they said that they don't have it anymore and even after searching for it they were unable to find one. The lightbulb socket looks like it was pulled apart by someone who didn't know how to open it properly, and the cover on the socket is missing. We measured voltage at the pins and found that 9 V AC supply the bulb. We bought a 12 V halogen lightbulb from Managua and soldered it onto wires to solder onto the prongs of the electric socket because we didn't have any alligator clips, which worked. We also cleaned the microscope lenses. One lens was loose, so we cut a finger of a latex glove and put it around the lens to fit it more tightly in the hole."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai","Bed, delivery",,,,Installation/Training,Repaired,"In external consulting there is an examination bed connected to the colposcope that is not in use because the nurses think that it is broken.

We opened it up, disconnected the cable, and stripped the insulation until we found a place where one of the wires had snapped. We cut the cable below that point, re-stripped the wires and attached them to the drill."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai",ECG Machine,Burdick,EK10,39936.0,Electric Simple,Abandoned,"The ECG technician gave us this device stating that other than the printer jamming and malfunctioning, it worked. We worked under this assumption and took apart the printer, cleaning it and greasing all of the gears. We then found a cable to test it out, but the device didn't appear to turn on because the screen and lights didn't change when plugged in. We opened the machine and traced the entry of power from the plug through the transformer and rectifier and found voltage was getting to the board by measuring across the optional battery pack connections. We disconnected the screen and measured that voltage was leaving the board to the screen as well. When we returned with the device to the doctor, she told us that the device had been taken to Managua earlier and when it was returned the screen displayed black stripes, which made us realize that the screen had probably died out. However, when we returned to test the machine the screen began to work and the machine still printed out traces with tons of noise."

When plugged in, the motor ran but there was no air coming out because the tubing was filled with dirt. We tried to take apart the vacuum to clean it, but couldn't get the screws off. The prosthetic technician helped us to get the screws out, but they were so old and tightly in that the screw heads broke off before they would come out. The screwdriver head became bent. We decided that the machine was just too old to fix, and had no way of getting it open anyway."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli","Kathy Lee, Anita Desai","Bed, delivery",,,,Installation/Training,Repaired,Nurses assumed this gynecological examination bed wasn't functioning because they didn't know how to use the pneumatic system to get it to raise and lower properly.

The exact number is on the other form that may or may not be able to be recovered. Most of the issues invovled leaky hoses, miscalibrated sphygnomanometers. All in all most fixes involved taking working spares and putting together working machines. The biggest issue was on the Reister BP cuffs with the sphygno and the pump on a single lead. The filter between these two tends to clog and needs cleaning. Of these we fixed about 10-15"

2012,,,,Phototherapy device,From peids,,,Electric Simple,Repaired,"We think someone plugged this into the wall without the transformer. There were a couple of fuses blown. The one fuse was bypassed and the other fuse was replaced. The second problem was that the bulbs are no longer UV bulbs, just halogen, and therefore not useful for phototherapy. We split up this device, and use the stand for functional phototherapy lights and the actual light was converted into an x-ray viewer and installed on the wall in the female general ward. This was converted to an x-ray viewer using laminated pieces of white paper."
