The previous 5 electode piece was taken for further examination.  Using the DMM for to test connections, one wire was not transmitting a current.  We quickly stripped the wire and used solder and heat shrink to fix the problem.  We returned to the ICU (in protected clothing) and tried this fixed cord.

This ECG portion of the machine was functioning just fine (although they were out of electrode pads).  The problem was the pulse oximeter portion of the machine was not recording a pulse on the screen.  The problem was that the machine was configured to display the pulse based on ECG reading.  But now that they couldn't use the machine for ECG without pads, they were wondering why the pulse oximeter connection didn't display pulse (it did successfully display s02).  We simply had to change the machine's pulse/HR input from ECG to pulse ox.  The machine immediately displayed a pulse and they were overjoyed."

We dissembled the machine and throughly scrubbed and scraped with screwdrives a gross amount of plaque in the water tank.  We then poured several tank fulls of water though the machine to rinse out the first layer.  We then ran the machine with clean water for an hour.  We opened up the machien to find the remaining plaque had moved and build up in the center of the autoclave.

Complained that sensor did not start motor - re-wired ""D.O.L. starter"" to allow for pressure sensor to actually start motor but current configuration is turning the motor on and off every ~15 seconds, which might wear on the motor. Current staff seemed unsure what they actually wanted, and so further work was abbandoned.

When we originally tested the machine we found the same problem but then realized we were not using the machine properly indicating possible user error.  When we opened the machine we found that the alarm back up batteries were not charged, 2 of the LEDs on the front panel were broken and there was a sitcky button on the front panel.  We charged the batteries, soldered the LEDs and cleaned/adjusted the button.  After charging the batteries with an outside charger we verified that the machine's internal charging system also works. After testing it, numbers flashing on the screen suggested a problem with a connection with the dial. We are currently looking into ordering a new one."

After ruling out the possibility of a problem with the LEDs, it was determined that it was likely a problem with the logic board. The screen using the skin temperature probe appeared to be working, however, the hospital does not have the proper probe attachment making that screen essntially useless. So, after looking at th manual and finding out that it might be a problem with a few diodes that were common to both displays, we attempted to desolder and switch the two sets of diodes, however this not fix the problem. It is likely an issue with the processor, which would have been impossible to desolder by hand. Instead, we are going to install a thermometer on the inside of the incubator that is easy to read so that the nurses will be able to see the temperature."

Upon inspection of the nebulizer at our workstation, we saw that the nebulizer actually generated sufficient airflow.  The external components were dirty, so we cleaned it with 99% alcohol.  We then went back to the ward, and personally tested the device in front of the hospital staff to show that there was sufficient airflow.  We then told them that the airflow was sufficient and informed them that machines with similar airflow would be sufficient as well.  The problem was essentially user error."

This nebulizer allowed us to better understand the mechanics of it and how it functions internally.  We collaborated with Joaquin and learned that the piston was the problem and that a new one was needed.  Joaquin told us it would be difficult to find one, so we moved onto another device"

After turning on the machine it appeared to work well, all of the gear systems were working and the fans, pumps and drainage systems appeared to be doing what they should have been doing with the exception of one of the pumps which added fluid to one of the reservoirs. We took apart this pump and rearranged the valve and cleaning the rust off all of the moving parts. It worked fine after that. We re-assembled the  machine and it was fully functional."

The medical staff were complaining that the air flow was impeded because although the device had 3 outlets, it only effectively nebulised one mask. We assumed that there was a clogged filter or pipe that was impeding airflow, so we disassembled the device and cleaned all of its pipes. After assembling the device the airflow was good, similar to that of a device that we repaired earlier but it was still not powerful enough to nebulise 3 masks. We came to the conclusion that they found a 3-way divider and attached it to the device but that the motor was not powerful enough to nebulise all 3 masks. We showed the nurses that if they closed 1 of the outlets they could nebulise 2 masks and explained that in order to get nebulisation in 2 masks it was necessary for the valve to be closed. "

We found this clinic through some American doctors that we met at our hospital. This was a hearing clinic that they were working at for a couple of weeks. The problem with the microscope was that the ceramic housing for the lightbulb had deteriorated to the point where the doctor had to take it out. He did not have the means to make a secure connection between the wires and the bulb so it was very loose and would often flicker and have to be adjusted. We removed the crimp wrapping and clips that he had attached which was making a faulty connection. We then soldered alligator clips to the ends of the wires, putting heat shrink wrap around the ends but not shrinking it. This stopped the clips from shorting but allowed for the light bulb to be attached and removed easily. "

We could not find anything wrong with the power supply. After taking another close look at the front of the device we realised that it was an incubator and also that there was a small kill switch at the front inside the door. After turning the switch on the machine it functioned well, a seal inside needed to be re-attached but other than that it worked perfectly well. We needed to talk to the hospital staff about how to use the machine properly because the fact that it was potentially being used for sterilisation is extremely dangerous. We also put it in the lab rather than in the sterilisation room where we found it."

We examined the lead and saw that it had been repaired before. We were getting continuity through all the leads except the 3rd so we assumed that was the problem. We removed the electrical tape which was on the outside of the lead and found a wire that had been used to bypass the broked one innside the lead. We removed it and replaced it. We assumed that we fixed the problem however the machine was getting alot of feed back. We replaced the wire with one of the same gauge as inside the cable and covered the entire thing in electric tape. The machine was getting much less feed back but it was still not back lot be put back into service. We tested the maching with a working lead and it worked perfectly which confirmed our concerns about the cable. We covered the outside of the cable with Aluminum foil which reduced the amount of noice that was being detected but it was still not working correctly.

We could not confirm that it was the cause of the problem, nor could we find a replacement.

It was obvious that the wire needed to have electrical contact with the pen when it is plugged in but there was nothing metal left for us to solder the wire on to inside the plug hole. We found a flat and very thin piece of metal and cut a small piece that we then rolled up so it could fit inside the hole with enough space for the pen to be inserted into the hole with it. We cut the metal piece so that after the length of the plug there was a long 'tail' onto which we could solder the wire. We glued this metal piece into the plug hole and soldered the wire onto it.

2015,Nicaragua,Louis Felipe Moncada/San Carlos,Aspirator/Suction Machine,Doctor's Friend,,,Plumbing,Repaired,"We were given a really old suction machine that did not have enough suction. We first looked for cloggs and leaks in the main tubes. The tubes were slighlty dirty but not enough to cause a significant change in the suction pressure. Next, we removed the motor and the filter that was conneced to the motor. We found that the filter was almost completely filled with dried blood and other gunk. We cleaned out the holes and made a new filter. we also cleaned out the area around the pistons and valves. When we put it back together, the suction pressure had more than doubled and was very strong. It was returned to us so we looked at it again and found a clog that we had missed. Afterwards, we sanded the rust off of it and then painted it."

At the lowest position the chain would catch and detatch so we opened up the motor controller and modified the motor controller so that it wouldn't go all the way down. Oiled and lubricated the chair and it works fine now.

2015,Nicaragua,Hospital Santiago (in Jinotepe) ,Centrifuge,Miami Medical,3411.0,819100.0,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"The initial problem was that the machine turned on, but the motor did not work. We fixed this by evenly sanding down the carbon brushes, but then found that the motor made a loud noise when operating. We found that one of the bearings was uneven, which broke when we tried to remove it. A replacement bearing was found at the ferreteria, and the machine was cleaned and returned to service."
2015,Nicaragua,Hospital Santiago (in Jinotepe) ,Incubator (infant),Aerogen,N/A,N/A,Electric Simple,,"The machine turned on and appeared to measure temperature correctly, but did not heat up. We assumed that the heating element was broken, but were not allowed to open the machine or replace it because the piece was still under warranty. A company representative will be coming to replace the heating element."

We checked the wiring on the buttons system to look for failed connections and found nothing. We then looked at the motor, which was charred black and obviously fried. When we plugged the fan in again to see the motor operating, we saw that it was indeed smoking. "

We researched the manual online, which suggested that the piece could not be fixed but that replacement parts could be obtained. We will attempt to get a replacement piece shipped."
2015,Nicaragua,Hospital Santiago (in Jinotepe) ,Pulse Oximeter,Acare Technology Company,AH-M1,12-100-0002,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"Of the five handheld pulse oximeters in the operating room, only one is functional. Two machines were sent to CEMED, one of which was returned fixed with a new on/off switch and the other of which could not be fixed because of a broken screen. Of the two remaining broken ones, we were able to determine that one was functional but could not be used to charge a battery and the other was broken, even with a fully charged battery. All in all, the OR now has three functional pulse oximeters, two of which operate and can be plugged in to charge the battery, and one that works if a charged battery is inserted (or non-rechargable batteries are used)."
2015,Nicaragua,Hospital Santiago (in Jinotepe) ,Blood Bank Refrigerator,Tianhan,YC-260L,,,,"The fridge is obviously brand new, and we originally assumed the problem was user error. We translated the manual into Spanish, programmed the refrigerator, and found that it cooled properly. However, we noticed that after about 30 minutes at the ideal temperature, the fan shut off and the fridge returned to ambient temperature."
2015,Nicaragua,Hospital Santiago (in Jinotepe) ,Scales (laboratory and in wards),Detecto,,,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,originally the scale was not registering any change in weight. To fix this we hooked the bottom base piece of the scale back to the scale column. We then recalibrated the scale.

She said it was something about how it was programmed. We looked up the manual and read that it should be in ""AUTO"". We changed the mode and returned the machine to the ER. "

2015,Rwanda,Ginduwe Hospical/Bushenge Hospital,"Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",Eastern Medical ,EA-632,##,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"Autoclave: the autoclave being used by the hospital was not heating to correct temperature and also not draining after the cycle was complete. First began by checking the filter and the tubing to see if it was clogged. The filter and tubing was cleaned, but autoclave still did not drain properly. It was determined that the electronic valve that releases the water was not functioning correctly. 

We started a cycle with the lid open to see if the heating element was working. The bottom element was not heating, making it impossible for the autoclave to sterilize. First checked power supply, and to our surprise there was sufficient power being supplied to the heating element. Using the multimeter we found that there was not continuity in the heating element.  Removed the heating element and cleaned it, but this did not fix the continuity problem. 

Our BMETs told us there was an identical autoclave in storage that was not working and had not been used in over 10 years. We tested the autoclave in storage, and found that it had a working heating element and control panel that was in much better condition. The problem was that it was missing a few parts like the electric valve, pressure release valve, back panel, and handles for opening the autoclave. It was also not getting sufficient power to the heating element and control panel. We double-checked the circuitry of the machine and found that a few of the connections had been removed, not allowing power to get to certain components. After reconnecting the cables, we were able to get power to the entire autoclave. We took the missing parts from the other autoclave, and got it to run a complete cycle! After a few tests, we can say we that we have a fully functioning autoclave for the hospital to use!

To make easier to diagnose the problem, we found out how to change the language to English in the settings menu. Once in English, it was determined that there were two error alarms going off on the incubator. The first was an indicating a low battery for the alarm. The second was indicating a malfunctioning patient sensor. This machine was one of two identical infant incubators in the room. We took the same sensor from the other incubator and tried it with the broken incubator. There was no alarm. Therefore we assumed that the sensor must be faulty. To confirm this, we plugged it into the working incubator. Surprisingly, it worked.

Low battery alarm, took out lithium battery inside machine. Turned out to be the Ram battery. The alarm battery was actually missing.  Need to replace.  Contacted the manufacturer and they gave us the exact specifications on replacing the alarm battery. 

The alarm battery is a standard Lithium battery size AA 3,6V / 2200mAh.

Low water level alarm was sounding. We simply added water to the distilled water supply. 

Ram battery error: After removing the Ram batter, and putting it back in, the machine was giving us an error. We were not able to find the fix for the error initially. Contacted the manufacturer, and they responded with. 

When the monitor is not working after replacement of the RAM battery and if the alarm is still there, the monitor must be re-initialized according to the enclosed instruction. For safety sake I also enclose a photo regarding the battery positions and a video showing the re-initialization.

Followed their instructions and now there is no ram batter error alarm.

The service manual told us to contact a Siemens representative is problem was not resolved. We found a rep in Kigali and immediately called. Handed the phone to x-ray tech who new the rep. This helped get the ball rolling on having the rep come out and help fix the x-ray machine. This was important because it is a new machine and still under warranty.  After further research, it we determined that the problem was in one of the contact pads in the xray machine. Since machine is under warranty, we thought it would be better to wait for Siemens rep who was scheduled to come on Thursday."

2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli",Other,Fein,FMM250,72293608231.0,Electric Simple,Repaired,"The prosthetic technician dropped his drill and it would only work when held a certain way, so we realized that the wiring by the base of the machine must be messed up. We opened it up, disconnected the cable, and stripped the insulation until we found a place where one of the wires had snapped. We cut the cable below that point, re-stripped the wires and attached them to the drill."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli",ECG Machine,Burdick,EK10,39936.0,"Electric Simple, Mechanical Simple",Abandoned,"The ECG technician gave us this device stating that other than the printer jamming and malfunctioning, it worked. We worked under this assumption and took apart the printer, cleaning it and greasing all of the gears. We then found a cable to test it out, but the device didn't appear to turn on because the screen and lights didn't change when plugged in. We opened the machine and traced the entry of power from the plug through the transformer and rectifier and found voltage was getting to the board by measuring across the optional battery pack connections. We disconnected the screen and measured that voltage was leaving the board to the screen as well. When we returned with the device to the doctor, she told us that the device had been taken to Managua earlier and when it was returned the screen displayed black stripes, which made us realize that the screen had probably died out. However, when we returned to test the machine the screen began to work and the machine still printed out traces with tons of noise."
2015,Nicaragua,"Hospital La Trinidad, La Trinidad, Esteli",Air Compressor,Schuco-vac,5711 130,,"Mechanical Simple, Other",Abandoned,"We found this vacuum in the maintenance workshop. When plugged in, the motor ran but there was no air coming out because the tubing was filled with dirt. We tried to take apart the vacuum to clean it, but couldn't get the screws off. The prosthetic technician helped us to get the screws out, but they were so old and tightly in that the screw heads broke off before they would come out. The screwdriver head became bent. We decided that the machine was just too old to fix, and had no way of getting it open anyway."

2019,Guatemala,Hospital Nacional de Retalhuleu/Retalhuleu,Other,Olympic,6-4297-02,29585.0,Electric Simple,Repaired,"**Billirubin Lamp**                                                                             Problem: There was a poor wiring to the LEDs. There were six transformers, one for each of the lights. A single wire came out of the right input of each  transformer, and all were soldered together. That solder point was not heat shrinked or covered at all and was touching the frame directly. Therefore, when plugged in and turned on, the frame would become very electric and shock. Another issue was the wiring of each light was different from each other, making  so some lights would work normally, and others would not. And also there was a broken transformer for one of the lights.                                                                                           Solution Attempt: Re-wire all of the lights so they have the exact same wiring, replace the broken transformer, and cover the open circuit so it doesn't electrify the frame of the device.                                                                            Test: A working transformer was taken from another Bili-lite that was non-functional, and replaced the broken transformer. A single light socket was tested throughly to see if the wiring is correct on it. That working socket was then the model for all other light sockets and every other socket was wired to replicate the tested one. And finally, the solder point with each transformer input was then heat shrinked, as well as, eletrical tape ovder the shrink wrap to ensure minimal exposure to rest of circuit.                                                                        End: With all the modifications to the circuit, each light socket was tested and performed correctly. Unfortunately, there are no blue lights for the Bili-lite, as well as, only three working starters for the six lights. If the hosptial wants full fuctionality of the device, it will need to buy six new blue lights and three new starters. A note was left onto the machine explaining the situation of the lamp and the type of bulbs and starters needed for replacement (in English and Spanish). But overall, the Bili-lite was fully fixed."

But the cutter itself does not respond to any of the buttons and therefore, does not cut.                            End: After inspection, we found that the one circuit board out of the 3 main control boards had a problem on it. We found this out when we tested the other ESU and found that both were in a similar state; so we inferred that they would have similar issues as well. And just like the other board, we didn't have the resources the fix the one circuit board, so the ESU was abandoned."

Test: After replacing the fuses, the machine still would not turn on. Next step was to open up top case and look into the electronics. The wires were traced to get an understanding of the function of the device. From look of the eye, no wires or components were broken or blown. Next step was to use a multimeter and test each compoment on the 3 control boards and see if a component has bad conductivity. From that, conductivity was good from each component. Next step is to replace broken fuses and test each circuit board to see where short occurs. Testing each circuit board consists of unplugging all inputs into starting circuit board except power. If fuses don't blow, add another circuit board to test and repeat. A single board was found and a continuity test was performed on the board. From the continuity test, nothing out of the ordinary was found. The machine was tested again, and from there we found it to be in a similar state as the other ESU; the main system recognizes pushing all the buttons but the cutter itself does not cut.

The seat was too far over  the top of the wheels and the feet rests were pushed too far forward, causing off balance when seated in it. Also, the brakes were on the wrong side, making so the brakes were inactive. Also, the seat would shake side to side causing more imbalance. And finally, the wheels were rusty causing difficulty to push the chair.                                                                       Test: The seat was pushed back over the top of the wheels, and feet rests were also pushed back to match with the seat. The brakes were switched to correctly stop on the wheel. The pipe holding the seat up had a single screw to stop shaking; that screw was tightened. And finally, the wheels were dissassembled  and cleaned throughly.                                                                                    End: The wheels provided full rotation, the brakes stopped the wheelchair when user presses on them, and when sitting in the seat, there was no off-balance feeling; the seat provided adaquite stability. Unfortunately, for the shaking, since  a single screw held the seat in place, minimal support was given to control the chair from swaying side to side. But we managed to secure the chair more in place and provided more stability. The chair was tested by user pushing himself around the hospital, using brakes to see if chair would hault, and testing overall feeling of stability while in the chair. From that, it was determined that the chair provided great stability and the brakes worked perfectly when applied. The wheelchair was fully fixed."

Solution Attempt: Dissassemble wheels to be cleaned, throughly clean entire machine, and prop  back up bottom table to be supportive again.                   Test: To fix the bottom table, two pieces of metal were placed on each corner, surronding the corner to provide support for each side of the bottom table. Unfortunately, there was no drill available to us, so screwing in the bolts were done manually by hand through the metal. The wheels were able to be dissassmbled, cleaned, and re-lubricated. And finally, the whole cabinet was thorughly cleaned, including sanding of some of the surface rust.                                              End: The two pieces of metal provided great support for the bottom table and the bottom table was secured into place. The wheels were able to spin again and rotate with less force.

Also, one wheel is broken on the metal sheet above the wheel, cuasing the wheel to tilt.

Test: The four wheels were removed and throughly cleaned to provide more  rotation when crib pushed. The wheels were able to be dissambled where they  were cleaned and re-lubricated. Unfortunately, after taking apart each wheel, it  was found that one wheel did not have an bearings in the axle. The bearings cannot be replaced without buying a whole new wheel. The broken wheel was then hammered into place, but after testing the whole bed, it was found that it would only re-position back into its broken status. So, instead the wheel was taken to a welder where the broken location was welded back together.                                                                                                  End: The wheels were able to rotate when applied some force. When the bed was fully assembled with wheels in place, the bed was a lot more mobile and required less force to push around, and all wheels were able to stay in place. The bed was then throughly cleaned, and it was found that baking soda, water, and a metal scrub brush is the best way to clean rust. The bed was fully fixed."

It did this even when the battery was removed. We tested continuity and determined that the power supply from the wall to the machine was functioning. We believe it is a problem with the circuit board. Possibly a component in the circuit board was blown or not functioning. We found a relay that gave zero voltage readings from the power supply. This may need to be replaced. These issues were beyond our knowledge as mechanical engineers.

The 100x lens needs immersion oil to function. The stage did not move horizontally and the sliding piece could be lifted out easily. We had a scrap microscope so we replaced the stage control and added rollers to the sliding piece which held it in. In order to do this, we had to remove the entire stage. The slide clamp had no spring mechanism to keep the slide in place, so we made a hook out of a paper clip to hold the spring, and soldered it all on.

The sliding piece on the stage could not move left and right,  the illuminator needed to be centered, and the eyepiece was not on correctly. We were not able to find a solution for the sliding piece on the stage after trying to place wires in between the roller tracks and making our own spherical rollers out of solder. The dimmer switch spun freely so we tightened the set screw so it had a hard stop. We found that the light did not flicker if the dial was spun slowly, so we left it as is.  We brought it back to the laboratory and the lab technician said that the sliding piece needed to be secured in order to use it so new rollers and tracks are needed for this microscope."

We used superglue to secure the rails and cleaned the rust off of the sliding clamp piece.

We cleaned all of the lens and glass pieces to ensure the blurry images were not from dirt or dust acumulation. The light seemed more dim than it should have been, so we took the bottom piece off the microscope and realized that the light was being blocked by a metal piece that had been bent. Upon working on the microscope upside down, the stage became detached from its track as it was only connected by the rollers and rack from the rack and pinion. Because of this, the rollers and roller housings came loose and will need to be replaced.  "

2019,Guatemala,Hospital Nacional de Retalhuleu/Retalhuleu,Otro,Olympic,6-4297-02,29585.0,Electric Simple,Repaired,"** Lámpara de Billirrubina ** Problema: hubo un mal cableado en los LED. Había seis transformadores, uno para cada una de las luces. Un solo cable salió de la entrada correcta de cada transformador, y todos se soldaron juntos. El punto de soldadura no se contrajo ni cubrió en absoluto y estaba tocando el marco directamente. Por lo tanto, cuando se enchufa y se enciende, el marco se volvería muy eléctrico y de choque. Otro problema fue que el cableado de cada luz era diferente entre sí, por lo que algunas luces funcionaban normalmente y otras no. Y también había un transformador roto para una de las luces. Intento de solución: vuelva a cablear todas las luces para que tengan exactamente el mismo cableado, reemplace el transformador roto y cubra el circuito abierto para que no electrifique el marco del dispositivo. Prueba: Se tomó un transformador de trabajo de otro Bili-lite que no funcionaba y se reemplazó el transformador roto. Se probó un solo zócalo de luz para ver si el cableado es correcto en él. Ese zócalo de trabajo era entonces el modelo para todos los demás zócalos de luz y todos los demás zócalos estaban cableados para replicar el probado. Y finalmente, el punto de soldadura con cada entrada del transformador se contrajo por calor, así como, la cinta eléctrica sobre la envoltura del encogimiento para asegurar una exposición mínima al resto del circuito. Fin: Con todas las modificaciones al circuito, cada toma de luz se probó y se realizó correctamente. Desafortunadamente, no hay luces azules para el Bili-lite, así como, solo tres entrantes que trabajan para las seis luces. Si el hospital quiere la funcionalidad completa del dispositivo, deberá comprar seis nuevas luces azules y tres nuevos entrantes. Se dejó una nota en la máquina explicando la situación de la lámpara y el tipo de bombillas y arrancadores necesarios para el reemplazo (en inglés y español).

It did this even when the battery was removed. We tested continuity and determined that the power supply from the wall to the machine was functioning. We believe it is a problem with the circuit board. Possibly a component in the circuit board was blown or not functioning. We found a relay that gave zero voltage readings from the power supply. This may need to be replaced. These issues were beyond our knowledge as mechanical engineers. 
2018,Dominican republic,"Hospital Regional Infantil Dr. Arturo Grullón, Santiago",Microscope ,Premiere,,1239008.0,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"Plugged it in, light did not turn on. Checked resistance across lightbulb and got no reading, therefore we needed a new lightbulb. We replaced the bulb and it worked. Tested the lenses and determined they all worked. The 100x lens needs immersion oil to function. The stage did not move horizontally and the sliding piece could be lifted out easily. We had a scrap microscope so we replaced the stage control and added rollers to the sliding piece which held it in. In order to do this, we had to remove the entire stage. The slide clamp had no spring mechanism to keep the slide in place, so we made a hook out of a paper clip to hold the spring, and soldered it all on. We replaced the eyepiece using one from the other microscope as the original was crooked.  "
2018,Dominican republic,"Hospital Regional Infantil Dr. Arturo Grullón, Santiago",ECG Machine,Edan,SE-3,31869-M13900500001,Power Supply,Repaired,We were told the ECG worked only sometimes. It powered on but we noticed that the lead plug into the machine was loose. We opened the machine and found that the pins from the plug to the circuit board had broken. We soldered these connections and used super glue to secure the plug to the housing. We tested it and the hospital worker Javier said that it worked. 
2018,Dominican republic,"Hospital Regional Infantil Dr. Arturo Grullón, Santiago",Microscope ,Premiere,,1238971.0,Power Supply,Abandoned,"When it was given to us we noticed the slide clamp was loose and the dimmer switch made the light flicker. The sliding piece on the stage could not move left and right,  the illuminator needed to be centered, and the eyepiece was not on correctly. We were not able to find a solution for the sliding piece on the stage after trying to place wires in between the roller tracks and making our own spherical rollers out of solder. The dimmer switch spun freely so we tightened the set screw so it had a hard stop. We found that the light did not flicker if the dial was spun slowly, so we left it as is.  We brought it back to the laboratory and the lab technician said that the sliding piece needed to be secured in order to use it so new rollers and tracks are needed for this microscope."
2018,Dominican republic,"Hospital Regional Infantil Dr. Arturo Grullón, Santiago",Microscope ,Fisher Scientific,Micromaster,12-561B,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"This microscope was given to us by the lab techician who said that the sliding piece did not slide. We used superglue to secure the rails and cleaned the rust off of the sliding clamp piece. When plugging in for final testing, we noticed the power cord only worked in a specific orientation so we opened the power cord and stripped the wires, soldered them, and then taped the wires with electrical tape and used silicone to seal the opening in the cord."
2018,Dominican republic,"Hospital Regional Infantil Dr. Arturo Grullón, Santiago",Microscope ,AusJENA,Laboval 4,M308868,Mechanical Simple,Abandoned,"The microscope was given to us by the lab technician who said that the 40X and 60X (two middle magnifications) were blurry. We cleaned all of the lens and glass pieces to ensure the blurry images were not from dirt or dust acumulation. The light seemed more dim than it should have been, so we took the bottom piece off the microscope and realized that the light was being blocked by a metal piece that had been bent. Upon working on the microscope upside down, the stage became detached from its track as it was only connected by the rollers and rack from the rack and pinion. Because of this, the rollers and roller housings came loose and will need to be replaced.  "

2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Air Conditioner,LG,H5-C1865DA4,05HAP4001,,,The Air-Con unit would drip water in one particular place after a few hours of use. We hypothesised this to be a build up of water in the bottom of the casing due to the a blocked filter. To fix the problem we cleaned the filter with pressurized air and a damp cloth. We also shortened the outlet pipe so it wouldn’t build up too much pressure on exit.
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",Trivp International Coorperation ,TRS-75L,13L-0070,,,The Autoclaves outlet tap was heavily blocked with gunk and the the fuse in the plug was blown. To fix this we unblokced the tap by taking it off and blowing compressed air through it. We then ran clean water through it and cleaned the inside of the Autoclave. We then replaced the fuse. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Other,(Kinetic Therapy) Fysiomed,Alfatrac HT,605.0,,,"A doctor came to us not knowing how to use the machine.

2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",DELI XI,TPS-50L,327.0,,,The release valves on the lid of the Autoclave were leaking pressure and also the pressure gauge did not work. To fix this we made seals for the release valves that would keep a tight fit to the main lid. We trialed a few different types of seals until we created a suitable one consisting of a thin sheet of hard gasket material with rubber sitting on top. This effectively blocked the release of pressure. We then took off the pressure gauge and realized that that the tube was blocked. So we just unblocked that so the gauge now worked.

2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Vacuum Extractor (for delivery),(Suction Pump) Seco,ASU 09,,,,"The pressure gauge on this machine had been completely snapped off. Also the input seal was leaking. To fix the snapped gauge we used epoxy to attached them back together along with black tape. This actually made quite a strong seal. To fix the input seal a connecting part just needed to be removed and not used, this meant it now had a tight enough seal to work properly."
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",DELI XI,TPS-50L,329.0,,,The release tap was blocked and the pressure release valves were leaking pressure. We unblocked the tap by taking it off and blowing pressurized air into the the machine through the tap opening. We then ran water through it to clean out any of the excess dirt. We then made the same seals as for the other Autoclave to give the release valves a tighter seal so they would no longer leak pressure. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",Sturdy Industrial Co.Ltd,SA-252F,252F-354691393,,,The plug end was completely shattered and had no fuse. To fix this we purchased a new plug end and attached this to the machine. We then put a new fuse in the plug. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Automatic Voltage Regulator,HanShin,HQ2000,,,,The power cable had been cut off. We replaced the power cable and changed the plug end for this power cable. The machine was als overy dirty so we cleaned it with a rag and damp cloth. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Electrosurgery Unit (ESU),Dalwha Corp.Ltd,Mediton 300 basic,BA3AK1008,,,The doctor said that when the machine was turned on an alarm sounded and it would not work. It turned out that the machine was set up for 2 ports when it only had 1 in. This just required us a button to change the setting from 2 to 1. We then explained to the doctor what happened and how what to do if the same thing happened again. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Vacuum Extractor (for delivery),(Suction Pump) Seco,ASU 09,,,,We took some parts from this suction pump for use in another one. We took out the glass from the pressure gauge and the float valve. So these parts will need to be replaced now. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Other,ESU Return Pad,,,,,One back padel for an ESU did not work as the connection was faulty. We stripped back the wires and resouldered them.
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Electrosurgery Unit (ESU),KLS Martin,MEMB3,MEMB3M0000110161,,,When the ESU is turned on it does not detect that the return pad is there so this causes an alarm and unable to operate the ESU. To fix this we reattached the electrode in the pad and refitted the casing. This meant that the ESU now detected the pad and so able to operate the device. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Vacuum Extractor (for delivery),(Suction Pump) Sturdy Industries,SS301 Superpower Suction Unit,SS3012249114797,,,The knob for changing from one canister to another was broken meaning that they could only fill up 1 as it was stuck to that side. We fixed the knob by replacing the grub screw. This meant that it could now turn and so the nurses can use both canisters. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Ultrasound Machine (imaging),EDAN,DUS 3,102254-M11900170008,,,The ultrasound machine had been reportedly dropped by one of the hospital staff. This meant that two of the screws had come off and a fuse had been dislodged. This was therefore an easy fixed as it only required us to put the screws back on and reinsert the fuse. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Patient Monitor,WelchAllyn,Spot vital signs Lxi,,,,"When we were first given this piece of equipment we were told that it would display an error message and not turn on. However when we turned it on, it worked perfectly. Obviously we were wary of this so we left it till the next day and turned it on again. It then displayed an error message that was not covered in the user manual. We openning it up to see if there were any faults but there were none that we could see. Therefore we had to abandon this equipment. "
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Patient Monitor,Anandic medical systems,259A,SBE06081606PA,,,This machine includes a fetal monitor and prints the pulse rate of the patient as well as displaying it on the screen. We were told that the problem was the values of the printed results did not match up to that of the electronically displayed values. This meant that the printing needle may have been offset. After aquiring the electrode leads to test the machine it was found that they did in fact match. This may have been a user error in that the nurse did not correctly place the paper in the machine correctly. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Defibrillator (automatic and manual),PROGETTI,Rescue Life,RL-13040997,,,The battery was dead in this machine. We tried to charge the battery but had no success. Therefore the hospital  ordeedr a new battery for 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Electrosurgery Unit (ESU),MEDITOM Daiwha Co.LTD,DT-300P,DT30EXP1508004,,,"There was confusion for the doctors between using this machine and the DT-400P as there are subtle differences in the way it is operated. For example the 300 would only  reach a certain strength or power of cutting while the 400 could go higher. This seemed to cause great confusion so we had to teach the staff that as they are sligthly different machines this is why that happens. We also tested both machines on an apple core at different strengths and measured the voltage to make sure it was stable, thus verifying that the machines were acceptagble for use."
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Electrosurgery Unit (ESU),MEDITOM Daiwha Co.LTD,DT-400P,,,,As above ^.
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Centrifuge,Gemmy industrial Corp,PLC-012E,12568.0,,,The centrifuge did not hold a stable rpm. We thought this may be due to worn out carbon brushes on the motor. We openned it up and found it to have two brushes. One of the brushes was completely destroyed so we replaced this. After replacing it the centrifuge now held a stable rpm at high speeds. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Bed, delivery",Burgerspital Solothurn,Bigla 5080,2223.0,,,In this bed the relay was broken so that only two out of three hydraulic arms worked. By replacing the relay all three arms worked.

This meant gas would leak, this could be potentially dangerous if there was anesthesia gas that leaked. Therefore we replaced the manifold so it no longer leaked gas. "
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Anesthesia Machine,(ventilator) ULCO Medical,EV500,3838.0,,,The battery in the ventilator is dead. Therefore it needs a new battery. Purchasing one will be required. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Bed, delivery",Burgerspital Solothurn,Bigla 5080,110.0,,,One of the relays was broken and the handle that is connected to the buttons for moving the bed was also broken. We replaced the broken relay and epoxyed the handle. We also replaced one of the fuses as it had blown. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)","Bed, delivery",Burgerspital Solothurn,Bigla 5080,1287.0,,,The transformer had become disconnected so we just reconnected it. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Patient Monitor,Mindray,MEC-1200,CC-33125549,,,This patient monitor was missing a battery so it is necessary to order this new part. It was also noted that the SPO2 input was not registering. This just turned out to be a faulty lead that was easy to replace. 
2017,Cambodia,"Kampot Provincial referal Hospital, Sonja Kill Hospital (KAMPOT)",Other,Electric Door,Flierl Hosptaltechnik AG ,H83 4054-1-HST-G97-T7,,,The electronic door works so that it is paired with another door so that only one can ever be open at the same time. However on one of the doors the transformer was broken so it did not supply the voltage to necessary to keep the electromagnets locking. Also the fuse was broken. We went to Phnom Pehn to buy a new transformer and fuse so once we installed these the door worked.

2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Aspirator/Suction Machine,JHAF,YX9300,1TL 613,Electric Simple,Repaired,Location: Main Operating Theater. Problem source was lack of switchfoot connection to suction pump.  Wire from switchfoot was taken and stripped; live and neutral wires of switchfoot were then soldered to the respective locations on the plug.  Suction pump was put back into service.
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Aspirator/Suction Machine,JHAF,YB DX23D-1A,1K3 025,Power Supply,Repaired,"Location: Main Operating Theater. Problem source was a missing plug at the end of the wire.  The live, neutral, and ground wires were placed without plug prongs into the outlet.  Plug box was attached to long wire (with fuse) and suction pump was put back into service."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Aspirator/Suction Machine,Fazzini,F-18,50286.0,Motor,Repaired,"Location: Children's Ward (Nyerere Ward). Found plastic/glue-like gunk around portion of motor enabling the fan to rotate.  Removed unknown substance from the motor area and rotated the area a bit until proper motion obtained.  Pressure was tested for the vacuum, and suction pump was returned to service."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Aspirator/Suction Machine,Monarch,,,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,"Location: Labor Ward. One of the tubes supplying air from the pump was pressed such that it made around a 90 degree angle.  This posed a problem in enabling smooth air flow through the tubing.  This problem was solved by tilting the motor forward to alleviate any contact from the lid causing a cutoff of airflow.  Furthermore, the tubing was cut and placed back on to shorten the tubing, remove any creasing along the tube inhibiting the air flow, and make more secure connections between the tubing and pipes.  Enhanced air flow was attained.  Another problem was that the pressure did not go beyond 150 mmHg, and after trying to identify different causes for this, no solution was found.  We suspect that perhaps the capacity of the motor is limited or the dial gauge showing the pressure may have some problems; however, we do not know for sure.  The suction pump is performing at a satisfactory level, therefore it was put back into service as per Charlie's orders (the technician with whom we were working).  "
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo","Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",Memmert,Tv15u,161112.0,Installation/Training,Repaired,"Location: Labor Ward. There seems to be misinformation on how to use the autoclave.  We explained the general functions - what the switches mean, for example.  There was nothing in particular wrong with the autoclave - it functioned properly and the alarms/automatic functions work.  One issue found was the markers on the dial had fallen off - possibly posting a more accurate picture of the dial can help alleviate any confusion with the temperature settings.  Autoclave was put back into service."

2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Centrifuge (electric or hand operated) ,Remi,R4,L120-5995,Other,Repaired,Location: Laboratory.  Small bag was stuck in the centrifuge - heard a distinct rattling and white object spinning on side of rotating portion inside of centrifuge.  Removed small bag - contained two springs - and tested balance of centrifuge; centrifuge functioning properly.  Only remaining issue is outlet used for centrifuge has lose connections with the plug.  Plug needs to be moved around in outlet to make proper electrical connection.  Solution to problem was to place a multi-functioning adaptor in which this particular centrifuge and another centrifuge using the same outlet can use the same plug point simultaneously.  The nurses have been told to power-off machines using the switches on them rather than plugging in/out continuously.
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo","Autoclave (lab, surgery, and other)",unknown,unknown,unknown,Mechanical Simple,Abandoned,"Location: Laboratory.  Rubber ring is no longer providing a tight connection between lid and cylinder.

Autoclave was not returned to service - a solution will be explored before returning to service."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Spectrophotometer/Colorimeter,Sherwood,252.0,12315.0,Other,Abandoned,"Location: Laboratory. 7/7/2010 - The complaint by the nurse for the machine was that the needle would not go all the way up when the dial was moved all the way to the right.  We calibrated the colorimeter by placing a sample of water into the machine and setting that to 0% absorbancy.  When the water was removed, the needle would go away from zero, and when placed back into the machine, the needle went to zero.  However, it would not always return to the exact zero position it was set at.  The major problem seems to be user error in using the dials to adjust the needle for calibration. 7/12/2010 - State of Colorimeter discussed with Charlie our technician - he said to abandon project and leave colorimeter as it is.  No further work will be done on this device."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Aspirator/Suction Machine,Ambu,,,Mechanical Simple,Repaired,Location: St. Joseph's Ward. Update - to solve the issue of putting the fluid collection box close to the pump a rubber band was securely attached around the perimeter of the suction pump.  Suction pump was tested several times and effectively vacuumed liquid into the fluid collection box.  Suction pump was put back into service.
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo","Blood Pressure Device, Manual (Sphygmomanometer) (Fixed or portable)",Tycos,Konstante I,7262632.0,Other,Repaired,"Location: St. Joseph's Ward. The blood pressure cuff was found to have a leak both in the bulb and inside the cuff.  To solve the problem of the leaking bulb (for pumping), the hole was super glued together and then a piece of rubber was super glued around the hole both near the hole and at the edges of the rubber square.  This was done to prevent any air leaks.  The leak inside the plastic cuff was repaired by zip-tying the specific area affected and preventing any air leaks at that point.  Sphygmomanometer was returned to service."

The cuff from this particular sphygmomanometer was used with the valve/bulb of another sphygmomanometer and the gauge dial was cut and zip-tied to prevent any air leaks at that point.  The sphygmomanometer was returned to service.
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Incubator (infant),Draeger,Inkubator 8000,317.0,Electric Simple,Repaired,"Location: Labor Ward Storage Room.  Several fuses were found to be not functioning and the power supply was not reading 220 V initially.  We replaced the fuses that were non-functional (specifically F3 and F4) and adjusted the power supply.  Incubator turned on; however, only a few buttons are giving the expected response.  An indicator for the fan was flashing - fan was checked inside and readjusted.  Incubator was then functioning properly.  Summary of problems faced: inadequate power supply, non-functional fuses (x2; main problem), and fan position/placement.  Humidity and temperature were tested and incubator reached desired temperature/humidity.  Oxygen levels could not be tested because oxygen tank was not available; Larry suggested we abandon the use of oxygen for the infant incubator and have the nurses/doctors use the humidity and temperature functions.  Infant incubator was returned to service."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Centrifuge,Digisystem,DSC-300SD,,Electric Simple,Repaired,"Location: Laboratory.  This particular centrifuge was experiencing only a single speed.  The medical technician had initially removed some key parts of the circuit, which made it difficult to assess a simpler solution to the singular speed it had.  To allow the centrifuge to at least be useful, the circuit was rewired to bypass the variable speed settings.  The motor was connected to a set of four diodes enabling a full-wave rectifier.  Furthermore, the timer was placed as a switch for this particular circuit such that when the timer reaches zero, the centrifuge also stops (i.e. the timer opens the AC power source and power is not given to the motor).  This equipment was put back into service."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Spectrophotometer/Colorimeter,"Jenway, Ltd.",6030.0,1926.0,Electric Simple,Abandoned,"Location: Laboratory.  The problem with the colorimeter was a removed ribbon going from the central circuit board to the screen.  This explains the difficulty in receiving functions from all the buttons and only the single use of the calibration function.  After looking at the ribbon that was removed, it was seen that the metal, conductive strips were too worn out to be salvaged.  Furthermore, resources to possibly repaint those strips with conductive material was not available.  Colorimeter was not returned to service because a feasible repair could not be made.  "
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Microscope ,Gakken-Eliza,ESL-B1S,983009.0,Other,Repaired,"Location: Laboratory.  This particular microscope had limited view in the eye pieces.  Initially, the light source was tested to see if it worked properly and the bulb was functioning.  Investigation into the lens and diaphragm were made and those were seen to function properly.  The eye pieces were then investigated and upon removal they were found to have severe internal cracks and external ridges on the inside part of the lens.  It was suspected maybe some kind of glue was used and acetone was applied to remove it - this did not work.  Replacement lenses were found for the microscope.  They are Carl Zeiss 10x 18L eye pieces, and they were tested on the microscope.  Several kinds of materials were placed underneath the microscope to ensure proper viewing of images.  Microscope was returned back to service."
2010,Tanzania,"Huruma Hospital, Rombo",Other,Carl Zeiss,10SL,100-127,Electric Simple,Repaired,"Location: Eye Department. Slit Lamp - the lenses and light bulb were investigated.  The lenses are in good condition; however, the light bulb is not functioning.  Solution to the problem is finding a replacement light bulb for this particular slit lamp.  The exact replacement cannot be found; however, a similar halogen lamp was found and a connection was made to the contact prongs and the light was positioned so that it provided high intensity light when it reflects off the mirror. Slit lamp returned to service."
