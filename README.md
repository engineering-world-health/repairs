# EWH Repairs Database

[Engineering World Health](http://www.ewh.org/)
has been collecting reports of equipment repairs by participants of the
[Summer Institute](http://www.ewh.org/summer-institute/program)
for several years.

This project aims to create a webpage app which allows exploration
of the database visually.

The
[original description](https://share.ewh.org/forum/innovation-and-design/bmet-library-development/programming-projects/109-equipment-repair-database)
for this project gives some additional details.

### Result

- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) for creating interactive graphs
- [heroku](https://herokuapp.com) for hosting the app
