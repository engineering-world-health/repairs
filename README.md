# EWH Repairs Database

[Engineering World Health](http://www.ewh.org/)
has been collecting reports of equipment repairs by participants of the
[Summer Institute](http://www.ewh.org/summer-institute/program)
for several years.

This project aims to create a webpage app which allows exploration
of the database visually.

The
